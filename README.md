# Submission for MIDAS Task 2

I've used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for performing all the tasks.

The three parts of the tasks have been split into two Jupyter Notebooks, which can be uploaded to Google Colab and run with a GPU instantly without any prerequisites or setup required.

Task 1 is in `midastask2part1.ipynb` and tasks 2 and 3 are in `midastask2part2-3.ipynb`.

I hereby declare that all the work done for this task is my own and I have provided due references which I have used for performing these experiments.
